| November before theory class | A block | I'm gonna be honest I didn't work-log my attempt of this compressor prior to the theory class as I was coding. I basically just coded the standard solution where you have an if-statement chain that converts whatever char it is to the binary it should print to the output. And of course I got the error with the extraneous zeros at the end, which I learned about during our theory day! |

I'll write an integer that holds the length of the data at the start, and when I expand my for-loop variable will be bounded by the length read at the start. |

So now I have three maps in my code, and LITERALLY zero if-statements! Huzzah! "You merely adopted constant time. I was born in it" -Bane |
